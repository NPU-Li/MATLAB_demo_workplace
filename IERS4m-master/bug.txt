it is faster than SOFA matlab.
bugs:
for the velocity rotation, one should not use the DS2R, which is defined by the solar day instead of the sidereal day. The real earth rotation rate is around 7.29e-5 instead of 7.27e-5. A simple way to verify, using the IERS.ERA to calculate epoch t and t+1second and subtract one from another and you can get the earth rotation rate.
The annotation for the EOP parameters are wrong but the code is correct. e.g. du is UT1-UTC.




To make it faster, in USNO
one may add one more line at the end of the function:
function this = initWithFinalsHttp (this,kind)

% save the EOP2000finalall.txt
save('EOP2000finalall.txt','data','-ascii')

end

replace this.bullA=this.initWithFinalsHttp(); in

function this = initWIthEOPdata(this,opt)

this.bullA=load('EOP2000finalall.txt');
end
